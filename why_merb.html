        <p>
          Like Ruby on Rails, Merb is an MVC framework. Unlike Rails, Merb is ORM-agnostic, JavaScript library agnostic, and template language agnostic, preferring plugins that add in support for a particular feature rather than trying to produce a monolithic library with everything in the core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merb is also thread-safe and was originally engineered to handle multiple file uploads concurrently.

      <div class='feature' id='light'>
        <h2>Lightweight</h2>
        <h3>A simple, clearly documented core</h3>
        <p>
          Rather than trying to cram every feature under the sun into a single code base, we keep things to the bare minimum, without sacrificing anything important.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core code in Merb is kept simple and well organised meaning it’s easier to understand, maintain and extend.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='feature' id='power'>
        <h2>Powerful</h2>
        <h3>Featureful, flexible and extensible</h3>
        <p>
          While we try to keep the core as minimal and clean as possible, this hasn’t meant a sacrifice of features. Merb has a very comprehensive set of features which we are continually improving. For example the new provides, which replaces the responds_to API.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any features that aren’t covered in Merb’s core, there are plugins. Rather than reinvent the wheel with a custom plugin framework, these are implemented as RubyGems, giving us easy plugin installation, updates and versioning.
